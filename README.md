# vinc_radio_ttgo
A TTGO Internet radio inspired by Volos projects

https://www.youtube.com/@VolosProjects

*TTGO/LILIGO board required, ESP32 required, R3 = no*

As this prog runs in MONO (not STEREO) only PIN26 and GND must be connected as Cinch/3.5mm output. Voltage/level will fit.

Sorry, bluetooth speakers currently not supported.
